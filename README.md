# Rosmaro
Changes of behavior modeled as a graph.
***
It's like an object where *this* is a statechart.

These are the [main goals of Rosmaro](https://rosmaro.js.org/#why-is-it-interesting) achieved by putting different behaviors into separated nodes of a graph:
* decoupled code
* readable model
* limited *if* statements

The [documentation of Rosmaro](https://rosmaro.js.org/) contains both simple examples and detailed explanation of every aspect of Rosmaro.


Installing is simple:
```
$ npm i rosmaro --save
```
For more details please check the "[Getting started](https://rosmaro.js.org/getting-started/)" chapter of the documentation.
