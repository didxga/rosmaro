# Rosmaro

Donâ€™t fight with boolean flags! Draw changes of behavior.

***

Rosmaro is a visual [automata-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata-based_programming) library for JavaScript.

It comes with a [visual editor](https://rosmaro.js.org/editor).

You draw a directed graph:

You write code, preferably functional:

You get a stateful object:

You may want to use Rosmaro to build rich user interfaces, safe back-end services or anything you want!
